	<h1>THACHPROOF PHONE CASES</h1>
		<div id="aboutTextWrapper"><p>Thacher's been through more phones than anyone I know. Whether it's forgetting it's in his pocket when he does a backflip into a watering hole, or smashing it in while doing the worm on the dance floor, Thacher has never ceased to invent ways to destroy phones. Thacher and I did a cross country bike trip together last year. While biking down the dirt roads of Kansas we stop to take some pictures only to realize Thacher doesn't have his phone. He had to change his tire (another item Thacher knows how to destroy often) a mile or two back, and he must have dropped it. Only two cars had passed us so if Thacher's phone was laying in the road there was a good chance he could get to it before it was run over. He saddles up and starts booking it back to where he had stopped. I see it in the distance; Thachers charging down this road on his bike, and from the other direction a car is charging towards him. It's within yards of where he stopped to change his tire, but the car gets there first. They pass each other, Thacher stops and picks up what we like to call a "spiderman edition phone". His iPhone had gone into a deep coma. He could still speak to Siri, but otherwise there were no signs of life. We then proceeded to chase a FedEx package with Thacher's new phone across Kansas for 300 miles, and after all this we decided Thacher's life career ought to be the design of the Thachproof phone. If the case would allow the phone to survive Thacher's lifestyle for oh say, 1 year, then it would officially be Thachproof. We never got around to starting that company but if there were any Thachproof candidates, it would be one of these cases here.</p></div>

Not only is it fully waterproof, its shockproof and it attaches to a little floatie accessory. I think both Thacher and I dropped phones overboard when we were living on the sailboat so that would have been nice to have.</div></a>

Gorilla glass over the front of this one gives you a free pass the first time you crack your screen.</div></a>
